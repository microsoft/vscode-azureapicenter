// This file contains the types used to communicate with our AI Driver service.
// These types should be kept in sync with the .NET types located in the AI Driver project.
//
// This file should not contain types that are specific to things happening in the client (in this
// case, the @azure VS Code extension. For example, types related to the extension's local plugin
// store, VS Code chat response streams, etc). Those should be kept in a separate typings file
// specific to the client. Doing so makes it easy for us to:
//
// - Ensure consistency between the .NET types located in the AI Driver project and here.
// - Use this file as a starting point for other TypeScript clients of the AI Driver service.
//
// Warning: make sure to use camelCase for the keys of properties. The AI Driver service will ignore
// properties that are not camelCase. For example: "prop" is ok. "Prop" will be ignored.
