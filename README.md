## Notice/Known Issues

- VS Code Insiders (version after 2024-01-19) is required to use the `@apicenter` agent with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Contents in VS Code workspace are not sent to GitHub Copilot.
- When the content of single spec is very large, the `@apicenter` agent may fail as the token limit of GitHub Copilot Chat is exceeded. This is a temporary limitation our team is working to remove.
- When the number of selected Azure Subscription is larger then 10, `@apicenter` agent may fail as it reaches call limit of Azure REST APIs.
