# Azure API Center for Visual Studio Code

Build, discover, try, and consume APIs using your favorite development environment.

### Build

Make APIs you are building discoverable to others by registering them with API Center directly or using CI/CD pipelines in GitHub or Azure DevOps.

Shift-left API design conformance checks into Visual Studio Code with integrated linting support, powered by Spectral.

Ensure that new API versions don't break API consumers with breaking change detection support, powered by Optic.

Explore API requests and responses with automated .http file generation powered by the [REST Client extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

### Consume

Generate API SDK clients for your favorite language including JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, Python, Java, and more, powered by the same [Microsoft Kiota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/overview) engine that generates SDKs for Microsoft Graph, GitHub, and more.

## Notice/Known Issues

- Contents in VS Code workspace are not sent to GitHub Copilot.
- When the content of single spec is very large, the `@apicenter` agent may fail as the token limit of GitHub Copilot Chat is exceeded. This is a temporary limitation our team is working to remove.
- When the number of selected Azure Subscription is larger then 10, `@apicenter` agent may fail as it reaches call limit of Azure REST APIs.
