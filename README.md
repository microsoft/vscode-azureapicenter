# Azure API Center for Visual Studio Code

Build, discover, try, and consume APIs using your favorite development environment.

### Build

Make APIs you are building discoverable to others by registering them with API Center directly or using CI/CD pipelines in GitHub or Azure DevOps.

Shift-left API design conformance checks into Visual Studio Code with integrated linting support, powered by Spectral.

### Consume

Generate API SDK clients for your favorite language including JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, Python, Java, and more, powered by the same [Microsoft Kiota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/overview) engine that generates SDKs for Microsoft Graph, GitHub, and more.

## Notice/Known Issues

- Contents in VS Code workspace are not sent to GitHub Copilot.
- When the content of single spec is very large, the `@apicenter` agent may fail as the token limit of GitHub Copilot Chat is exceeded. This is a temporary limitation our team is working to remove.
- When the number of selected Azure Subscription is larger then 10, `@apicenter` agent may fail as it reaches call limit of Azure REST APIs.
