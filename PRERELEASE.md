The 1.1 release of the Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code provides three new key capabilities:

2. Generating Open API specification from a API code
3. Deprecation of Azure account extension 

Generating Markdown documentation for a API
We have added a new command in the tree view of API definition called "Generate Markdown" to allow developers to easily generate markdown documentation.

Generating Open API specification from a API code
Developers now can right click on any API code and invoke the "Generate API documentation" menu (under Copilot) to generate Open API specification document when provided with API code.
